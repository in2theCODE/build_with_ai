Event Architecture for Multi-Phase Code Generation Application
Based on your detailed description, I can now provide a tailored event pattern recommendation for your specific application with its three distinct phases.

Application Flow Analysis
Phase 1: Spec Sheets & Algorithm
User provides inputs  Mathematical algorithm processes inputs System generates empty 
spec sheets for download Spec sheets will be able to cover the entire projects needs and initial 
generation of spec sheets will be the fields  with empty values. The values are input in the next
phase and is done withthe help of the assistant.
Phase 2: AI-Assisted Spec Sheet Completion
User uploads or calls them from the db. The spec sheets wil then be in the current state so the ai
and the user can both see the spec sheets. The ai will have a perfect context window into all of 
the spec sheets at once. Therefor naming and other things that become inconsistent when generating
code with ai is overcome. This solve alot more problms that incur using ai as code assistants as well.
AI processes all sheets in one context window when finished filling them out. Like I said before this
part is very important to maintane the Consistent naming, imports, and state. The User then receives
filled spec sheets or sends them to the db.
Phase 3: Final Application File Generation
User submits filled spec sheets in batches or at once it does not matter now due to the spec sheets 
having the consistent values. You can turn them in one at a time even and start a new session and all
values will always remain consistent.
Recommended Event Architecture
I recommend an Event Sourcing with State Snapshots pattern, implemented through Apache Pulsar as follows:

Topic Structure
app/
├── projects/{project-id}/
│   ├── phase1/
│   │   ├── input-received
│   │   ├── algorithm-completed
│   │   └── spec-sheets-generated
│   ├── phase2/
│   │   └── application-completed
│   └── state-snapshots/
│       ├── post-phase1
│       ├── post-phase2
│       └── current

Key Components
Event Sourcing

Each user action and system response is recorded as an immutable event
Complete audit trail of the entire generation process
Critical for debugging AI behavior and improving algorithms
State Snapshots

After each phase, store a complete snapshot of the application state
Includes naming conventions, imports, relationships between components
Serves as context for the next phase
Prevents state drift between phases
Materialized Views

Create specialized read models from events
Track progress through the workflow
Monitor AI performance and consistency
Pulsar Functions

Process events and trigger appropriate actions
Coordinate with AI services
Handle error recovery
Implementation Benefits
This architecture specifically addresses your application's needs by:

Maintaining Consistency

State snapshots ensure naming and imports remain consistent
Events track all changes to prevent out-of-sync components
Supporting Batch Processing

Phase 3's flexible submission pattern is supported by independent processing events
State is preserved regardless of submission timing
Preserving Context

AI has access to full context through state snapshots
Prevents the "out of whack" state problems common in AI systems
Scalability

Handles growing projects with increasing complexity
Supports parallel processing where appropriate
Practical Implementation
For your implementation, I recommend:

Use Pulsar's Schema Registry to enforce strict event schemas
Implement compacted topics for state snapshots
Use Pulsar transactions for phase transitions
Implement dead-letter queues for handling AI processing failures
Consider Pulsar Functions for coordinating AI service calls
This approach gives you a robust foundation that maintains state integrity across all three phases while providing the flexibility needed for your AI-driven code generation workflow.

oh also I forgot to ask right now the spec sheet phase and filling them out it's actually done all at once you get you download them and they already filled out that's how I hold the same context and all the same spec sheets and it's a separate application from the code generation so right now they're separate the phase one is it's like a flat config in a project the phase2 is set up like Apache so how do I integrate the first phase into the second phase

Integrating Phase 1 into Phase 2 with Apache Pulsar
I understand now that your system actually has these characteristics:

Phase 1 generates spec sheets based on user inputs and algorithms
Phase 2 immediately fills these spec sheets (not requiring user download/upload)
These phases currently exist as separate applications
Phase 1 uses a flat config in a project structure
Phase 2 is set up like Apache
You want to integrate Phase 1 into Phase 2
Here's how to integrate them using Apache Pulsar:

Integration Architecture
1. Event Bridge Pattern
Create a bridge between your flat config system and Apache-style system using Pulsar:

flat-config-system/ <---> pulsar-bridge <---> apache-style-system/

2. Topic Structure
integration/
├── phase1-to-phase2/
│   ├── spec-sheets-generated
│   ├── transfer-initiated
│   ├── transfer-completed
│   └── processing-started
├── configuration/
│   ├── mapping-rules
│   └── transformation-templates
└── state/
    └── shared-context

Implementation Steps
1. Create a Pulsar Producer in Phase 1
// In your Phase 1 application
public class Phase1Completion {
    private PulsarClient client;
    private Producer<SpecSheetPackage> producer;

    public void initialize() {
        client = PulsarClient.builder()
            .serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
            .build();

        producer = client.newProducer(Schema.AVRO(SpecSheetPackage.class))
            .topic("integration/phase1-to-phase2/spec-sheets-generated")
            .create();
    }

    public void completePhase1(SpecSheetPackage sheets) {
        // When Phase 1 completes, send the spec sheets to Pulsar
        producer.send(sheets);
    }
}

2. Create a Pulsar Consumer in Phase 2
// In your Phase 2 application
public class Phase2Starter {
    private PulsarClient client;
    private Consumer<SpecSheetPackage> consumer;

    public void initialize() {
        client = PulsarClient.builder()
            .serviceUrl("pulsar://localhost:6650")
            .build();

        consumer = client.newConsumer(Schema.AVRO(SpecSheetPackage.class))
            .topic("integration/phase1-to-phase2/spec-sheets-generated")
            .subscriptionName("phase2-processor")
            .subscriptionType(SubscriptionType.Exclusive)
            .subscribe();
    }

    public void startListening() {
        // Start a thread to listen for incoming spec sheets
        while (true) {
            Message<SpecSheetPackage> msg = consumer.receive();
            try {
                SpecSheetPackage sheets = msg.getValue();
                // Process the spec sheets with your AI
                processSpecSheets(sheets);
                // Acknowledge the message
                consumer.acknowledge(msg);
            } catch (Exception e) {
                // Handle errors
                consumer.negativeAcknowledge(msg);
            }
        }
    }

    private void processSpecSheets(SpecSheetPackage sheets) {
        // Your existing Phase 2 logic
    }
}

3. Create a Common Data Schema
Define a shared schema for the spec sheets package:

@Data
public class SpecSheetPackage {
    private String projectId;
    private Map<String, SpecSheet> specSheets;
    private Map<String, Object> contextData;

    // Include any metadata needed for processing
    private Map<String, String> namingConventions;
    private List<String> importStatements;
}

Advanced Integration Features
1. Context Preservation
To ensure context preservation across phases:

// When sending from Phase 1
MessageBuilder<SpecSheetPackage> messageBuilder = producer.newMessage();
messageBuilder.value(sheets)
    .property("projectContext", objectMapper.writeValueAsString(projectContext))
    .property("algorithmVersion", "1.2.3")
    .send();

2. Configuration Synchronization
Use Pulsar's compacted topics to maintain configuration synchronization:

// Create a compacted topic for configuration
admin.topics().createNonPartitionedTopic("integration/configuration/mapping-rules");
admin.topics().setCompactionThreshold("integration/configuration/mapping-rules", 1000);

// Publish configuration updates
Producer<ConfigUpdate> configProducer = client.newProducer(Schema.AVRO(ConfigUpdate.class))
    .topic("integration/configuration/mapping-rules")
    .create();

configProducer.send(new ConfigUpdate("key1", newValue));

3. Monitoring Integration Health
Add health monitoring topics:

// Publish health status
producer.newMessage()
    .value(new HealthStatus("phase1", "healthy", System.currentTimeMillis()))
    .send();

Implementation Recommendations
Start with a Minimal Viable Integration:

Begin by just passing the spec sheets from Phase 1 to Phase 2
Don't try to refactor everything at once
Use Schema Registry:

Register your SpecSheetPackage schema in Pulsar's schema registry
Ensures consistent data format across both applications
Implement Circuit Breakers:

If Phase 2 is unavailable, allow Phase 1 to still function
Store messages for later processing
Add Observability:

Track message flow between systems
Monitor processing times and success rates
Consider Event Sourcing:

Store all spec sheets and transformations
Allows for replay and debugging
This approach allows you to integrate your systems while maintaining their current architecture, gradually moving toward a more unified system as needed.

oh yeah are you saying to keep them in separate repos just add a bunch of complexity

Simplified Integration Approach
You're absolutely right - I overengineered the solution. Let's simplify this dramatically:

Single Codebase Integration
Instead of keeping separate applications with complex messaging between them, the simplest approach is to:

Merge the codebases into a single application
Use Pulsar only for workflow orchestration, not inter-app communication
Simplified Implementation
1. Combined Service Architecture
public class CodeGenerationService {

    // Phase 1: Generate spec sheets based on satisfaction inputs
    public SpecSheetPackage generateSpecSheets(UserInputs inputs) {
        // Your existing Phase 1 algorithm
        SpecSheetPackage emptySheets = algorithmService.processInputs(inputs);

        // Directly move to Phase 2
        return fillSpecSheets(emptySheets);
    }

    // Phase 2: Fill spec sheets with AI
    private SpecSheetPackage fillSpecSheets(SpecSheetPackage emptySheets) {
        // Your existing Phase 2 AI processing
        return aiService.processAllSheets(emptySheets);
    }

    // Phase 3: Generate final code
    public ApplicationFiles generateCode(SpecSheetPackage filledSheets) {
        // Your existing Phase 3 code generation
        return codeGenerationService.createApplicationFiles(filledSheets);
    }
}

2. Simple Pulsar Workflow
Use Pulsar only to track the workflow state and provide durability:

@Service
public class WorkflowService {

    private final PulsarClient pulsarClient;
    private final CodeGenerationService codeGenService;

    public void startWorkflow(String projectId, UserInputs inputs) {
        // Record start of workflow
        publishEvent(projectId, "workflow-started", Map.of("inputs", inputs));

        try {
            // Run Phase 1 & 2 together
            SpecSheetPackage filledSheets = codeGenService.generateSpecSheets(inputs);

            // Record completion and store the filled sheets for later use
            publishEvent(projectId, "spec-sheets-completed", Map.of(
                "sheetCount", filledSheets.getSpecSheets().size()
            ));

            // Store the actual sheets in a state store (could be Pulsar or a database)
            storeSpecSheets(projectId, filledSheets);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            publishEvent(projectId, "workflow-error", Map.of("error", e.getMessage()));
        }
    }

    public void generateCode(String projectId) {
        // Record start of code generation
        publishEvent(projectId, "code-generation-started", Map.of());

        try {
            // Retrieve the stored spec sheets
            SpecSheetPackage sheets = retrieveSpecSheets(projectId);

            // Generate the code
            ApplicationFiles files = codeGenService.generateCode(sheets);

            // Record completion
            publishEvent(projectId, "code-generation-completed", Map.of(
                "fileCount", files.getFiles().size()
            ));

            // Store the generated files
            storeGeneratedFiles(projectId, files);

        } catch (Exception e) {
            publishEvent(projectId, "code-generation-error", Map.of("error", e.getMessage()));
        }
    }

    private void publishEvent(String projectId, String eventType, Map<String, Object> data) {
        // Simplified event publishing
        Producer<GenericRecord> producer = pulsarClient.newProducer(Schema.AUTO_CONSUME())
            .topic("projects/" + projectId + "/events")
            .create();

        GenericRecord record = GenericRecordBuilder.create()
            .set("eventType", eventType)
            .set("timestamp", System.currentTimeMillis())
            .set("data", data)
            .build();

        producer.send(record);
    }
}

Benefits of This Approach
Much simpler architecture - direct method calls instead of complex messaging
Single codebase - easier to maintain and debug
Consistent context - all data stays in memory during processing
Still leverages Pulsar - for event logging and workflow tracking
Easier deployment - one application instead of multiple services
Implementation Steps
Create a new unified project (or choose one of your existing ones)
Move the core logic from both applications into appropriate service classes
Set up Pulsar for workflow tracking, not inter-service communication
Add appropriate error handling and state management
Implement a simple REST API for triggering the workflow
This approach gives you all the benefits of your current process but with dramatically reduced complexity and no need to coordinate between separate applications.

since pycharm has that feature they let you map out the directory structures and all that what's the best way to get that information into some sort of configuration schema or something so that I can use it as context to help me with my assistant finish the application

Converting PyCharm Directory Structure to Configuration Schema
PyCharm's directory structure visualization can be leveraged to create a configuration schema that provides context for your code generation assistant. Here's how to efficiently capture and utilize this information:

Approach Options
1. Export and Parse PyCharm Structure
PyCharm doesn't have a built-in export for directory structures, but you can:

import os
import json

def scan_directory(root_path, ignore_patterns=None):
    """Scan directory and create a structured representation."""
    if ignore_patterns is None:
        ignore_patterns = ['.git', '__pycache__', '*.pyc', '.idea', 'venv']

    result = {'name': os.path.basename(root_path), 'type': 'directory', 'children': []}

    for item in os.listdir(root_path):
        # Skip ignored patterns
        if any(os.path.fnmatch.fnmatch(item, pattern) for pattern in ignore_patterns):
            continue

        path = os.path.join(root_path, item)
        if os.path.isdir(path):
            result['children'].append(scan_directory(path, ignore_patterns))
        else:
            # For files, you might want to include additional metadata
            result['children'].append({
                'name': item,
                'type': 'file',
                'extension': os.path.splitext(item)[1],
                # Optionally add more file metadata
                # 'size': os.path.getsize(path),
                # 'modified': os.path.getmtime(path)
            })

    return result

# Use the function
project_structure = scan_directory('/path/to/your/project')
with open('project_structure.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(project_structure, f, indent=2)

2. Schema Definition for Project Structure
Create a JSON Schema that describes your project structure format:

{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Project Structure Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the directory or file"
    },
    "type": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["directory", "file"],
      "description": "Type of the item"
    },
    "children": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "$ref": "#"
      },
      "description": "Child items (for directories only)"
    },
    "extension": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "File extension (for files only)"
    },
    "metadata": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Additional metadata about the item",
      "properties": {
        "role": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Purpose of this file/directory in the project"
        },
        "dependencies": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "description": "Other files/directories this item depends on"
        },
        "description": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "Human-readable description of the item's purpose"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["name", "type"]
}

Integration with Your Assistant
1. Store in Pulsar for Context
def store_project_structure(project_id, structure):
    """Store project structure in Pulsar for context."""
    client = pulsar.Client('pulsar://localhost:6650')
    producer = client.create_producer(
        topic=f'projects/{project_id}/structure',
        schema=pulsar.schema.JsonSchema(ProjectStructure)
    )

    producer.send({
        'projectId': project_id,
        'structure': structure,
        'timestamp': int(time.time() * 1000)
    })

    client.close()

2. Enhanced Schema with Code Generation Hints
For maximum usefulness to your assistant, enhance the structure with code generation hints:

{
  "name": "my-project",
  "type": "directory",
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "src",
      "type": "directory",
      "metadata": {
        "role": "source_code",
        "description": "Contains all application source code"
      },
      "children": [
        {
          "name": "models",
          "type": "directory",
          "metadata": {
            "role": "data_models",
            "description": "Data model definitions",
            "codeGenHints": {
              "naming": "PascalCase",
              "baseClass": "BaseModel",
              "imports": ["from pydantic import BaseModel", "from typing import Optional, List"]
            }
          },
          "children": []
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

3. Command-Line Tool for Structure Capture
Create a simple CLI tool to capture and update the structure:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import argparse
import json
import os
import sys

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Project structure tool')
    parser.add_argument('command', choices=['capture', 'update', 'view'])
    parser.add_argument('--project-id', required=True, help='Project identifier')
    parser.add_argument('--path', default='.', help='Project root path')
    parser.add_argument('--output', help='Output file (default: project_structure.json)')

    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.command == 'capture':
        structure = scan_directory(args.path)
        output_file = args.output or f'{args.project_id}_structure.json'
        with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(structure, f, indent=2)
        print(f"Structure captured to {output_file}")

        # Optionally store in Pulsar
        if os.environ.get('USE_PULSAR') == 'true':
            store_project_structure(args.project_id, structure)

    # Implement other commands...

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Using the Structure with Your Assistant
Provide as Context: Include the structure JSON in your requests to the assistant

Reference in Prompts: "Based on the project structure provided, generate code for the user service that follows the established patterns."

Create Templates: Use the structure to generate templates that match your project organization:

def generate_template(structure, path_parts):
    """Generate a file template based on structure and path."""
    current = structure
    for part in path_parts:
        if current['type'] != 'directory':
            return None

        for child in current.get('children', []):
            if child['name'] == part:
                current = child
                break
        else:
            return None

    # Now current points to the target node
    metadata = current.get('metadata', {})
    template = []

    # Add imports
    for imp in metadata.get('codeGenHints', {}).get('imports', []):
        template.append(imp)

    # Add base class if applicable
    base_class = metadata.get('codeGenHints', {}).get('baseClass')
    if current['type'] == 'file' and base_class:
        template.append(f"\n\nclass {os.path.splitext(current['name'])[0]}({base_class}):")
        template.append("    pass")

    return "\n".join(template)

Practical Implementation Plan
Create the structure capture script (as shown above)
Run it on your project to generate the initial structure JSON
Enhance manually with metadata and code generation hints
Store in Pulsar using a compacted topic for easy retrieval
Create an API endpoint that your assistant can call to get the latest structure
Update your assistant's prompt to include instructions on using the structure
This approach gives your assistant rich context about your project organization, naming conventions, and code patterns, making it much more effective at generating code that fits seamlessly into your application.

driven architecture:

Event Bus Implementation (from paste-2.txt): The EventBus class provides a solid Pulsar-based event system with proper publish/subscribe patterns.
Component Base Classes (from paste-2.txt): The BaseService class offers a framework for building event-driven microservices.
Pulsar Infrastructure (from setup.sh): The Docker-based Pulsar setup provides the messaging backbone needed for the event system.
Service Entry Points (from entry.sh): The service entry script shows how individual services can be initialized.
Specialized Event-Driven Services: The scripts like event_relationship_analyzer.py, event_template_generator.py, etc., demonstrate how to build specialized services that communicate via events.

These scripts align well with the hybrid architecture approach you're considering.
The Hybrid Event-Driven Architecture
A hybrid event-driven architecture for your program synthesis system would combine:

Synchronous API Layer: For immediate user interactions
Asynchronous Event Core: For background processing and inter-service communication

This approach offers several advantages:

Decoupling: Components only need to know about events, not about each other
Scalability: Services can scale independently based on workload
Resilience: Failures in one component don't cascade through the system
Progressive Enhancement: Easy to add new capabilities without disrupting existing ones

Handling State in an Event-Driven System
In your event-driven synthesis system, state management is crucial. Here's how you can handle it:
1. Event Sourcing Pattern
The orchestration service in paste-2.txt implements a simple form of event sourcing by tracking tasks in pending_tasks. A more robust implementation would:
python# Store all events as the source of truth
def store_event(self, event_type, payload):
    # Store in a database like the PostgreSQL included in setup.sh
    event_id = self.event_store.store({
        "event_type": event_type,
        "payload": payload,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    })
    return event_id

# Rebuild state from events
def rebuild_state(self, specification_id):
    events = self.event_store.get_events_for_entity(specification_id)
    state = {}
    for event in sorted(events, key=lambda e: e["timestamp"]):
        # Apply event to state based on event type
        self._apply_event_to_state(state, event)
    return state
2. Materialized Views
For fast access to current state, maintain materialized views updated by events:
python# Event handler that updates materialized view
async def handle_code_generation_completed(self, event):
    spec_id = event.payload.get("specification_id")
    
    # Update the materialized view in database
    await self.specification_view.update(
        spec_id,
        {
            "status": "code_generated",
            "code": event.payload.get("result", {}).get("code"),
            "last_updated": datetime.utcnow()
        }
    )
3. Using Qdrant for Vector State
Your setup.sh includes Qdrant, which is perfect for storing vector embeddings for retrieval-augmented generation:
python# Store code embeddings in Qdrant
async def store_code_embedding(self, code_id, code_text, embedding):
    await self.qdrant_client.upsert(
        collection_name="code_embeddings",
        points=[{
            "id": code_id,

Integrating Your Current Scripts
The scripts you've provided would integrate into this architecture as follows:

NeuralCodeGeneratorService becomes an event processor that:

Consumes CODE_GENERATION_REQUESTED events
Performs generation
Produces CODE_GENERATION_COMPLETED events


SynthesisOrchestratorService becomes the workflow coordinator that:

Tracks the state of each synthesis request
Decides what events to emit based on the current state
Handles failure scenarios and retries


Event-driven relationships from your analyzer scripts provide dynamic discovery capabilities between components.

Implementation Recommendations
Based on your files, I recommend:

Implement CQRS Pattern: Separate read and write operations

Commands: Submit specification, Request code generation
Queries: Get specification status, Retrieve generated code


Add Event Versioning:

pythonclass EventSchema:
    SPECIFICATION_SUBMITTED_V1 = "specification.submitted.v1"
    # When schema evolves
    SPECIFICATION_SUBMITTED_V2 = "specification.submitted.v2"

Implement Event-Driven API Integration:

python@router.post("/generate-code")
async def generate_code(
    request: GenerationRequest,
    background_tasks: BackgroundTasks
):
    # Generate a request ID
    request_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
    
    # Publish event asynchronously
    background_tasks.add_task(
        event_bus.publish,
        BaseEvent(
            event_type=EventType.CODE_GENERATION_REQUESTED.value,
            producer="api",
            payload={
                "specification": request.specification,
                "language": request.language,
                "request_id": request_id
            }
        )
    )
    
    # Return immediately with tracking ID
    return {"request_id": request_id, "status": "processing"}

Add Real-time Updates via WebSockets:

python@app.websocket("/ws/{client_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, client_id: str):
    await websocket.accept()
    
    # Subscribe to client-specific events
    async def client_event_handler(event: BaseEvent):
        if event.metadata.get("client_id") == client_id:
            await websocket.send_json({
                "event_type": event.event_type,
                "payload": event.payload
            })
    
    # Subscribe to relevant events
    await event_bus.subscribe(
        EventType.CODE_GENERATION_COMPLETED,
        client_event_handler,
        f"client-{client_id}"
    )
By implementing these patterns, you'll have a robust, scalable event-driven architecture for your program synthesis system that can handle both immediate user needs and complex background processing.Retrynueral_interpretor.py1,001 linespyintent_analyzer.py145 linespypattern_matcher.py162 linespyevent_bus.py72 linespyclient.py334 linespyconfig.py187 linespyevents.py237 linespyprometheus_prod.yaml84 linesyamlbase_event.py28 linespyevents.py237 linespymodels.py77 linespycontainer_events.py116 linespytasks_role_map.yaml125 linesyamldeploy_pulsar.sh655 linesshJRthese are from another application that is agent based, tell me out of everything ive shown you so far what can we apply to the code generation event system that will be a hybrid like setup for all of the benefits from both . i have eveytrhing we need pretty much we would just have to adapt it and change the nameing convewntions to fi the new narrative please tell me how to move forward cover as much ground ass you can in your responseBitch ass man give me a planEditI've analyzed all the code and scripts you've provided, and I can see a clear path forward for implementing a hybrid event-driven system for your code generation application. Let's synthesize everything into a comprehensive implementation plan.
Key Components to Adapt from Your Codebase
Your codebase contains several excellent components that can be adapted for your code generation system:

Neural Interpreter Core (nueral_interpretor.py): This provides an advanced task classification system that can be repurposed for code generation requests.
Event Bus Implementation (event_bus.py, client.py): The Pulsar-based event bus infrastructure is robust and ready to use.
Pattern Matcher (pattern_matcher.py): This can be adapted to identify common code generation patterns for fast-path processing.
Intent Analyzer (intent_analyzer.py): The system for determining processing modes (reactive vs. deliberative) fits perfectly with code generation requirements.
Pulsar Infrastructure (setup.sh, deploy_pulsar.sh): The deployment scripts provide a production-ready Pulsar cluster.

Adapted from Your Current Code:
python# Rename NeuralInterpreter to CodeGenerationInterpreter
class CodeGenerationInterpreter:
    """
    Core interpreter that analyzes code generation requests and 
    publishes them to the appropriate Pulsar topics.
    """
    def __init__(
            self,
            pulsar_url: str = "pulsar://localhost:6650",
            code_request_topic: str = "persistent://public/default/code-generation-requests",
            code_response_topic: str = "persistent://public/default/code-generation-responses",
            metrics_topic: str = "persistent://public/default/metrics"
    ):
        # Initialize from nueral_interpretor.py but rename components
        self.metadata_analyzer = CodeRequestAnalyzer()  # Derived from MetadataAnalyzer
        # Rest of initialization similar to NeuralInterpreter
2. Processing Mode Determination
Adapt the ProcessingMode concept for code generation tasks:
pythonclass ProcessingMode(str, Enum):
    """Processing modes for code generation"""
    REACTIVE = "reactive"  # Fast path for simple code generation
    DELIBERATIVE = "deliberative"  # Complex path for sophisticated code generation
    COLLABORATIVE = "collaborative"  # Requires multiple services working together
The decision logic would be updated:

    """Determine processing mode based on request complexity"""
    
    # Check for pattern match (e.g., common code snippets)
    if metadata.pattern_match and metadata.pattern_match.score > 0.9:

        metadata.complexity.context_depth > 7 or
        metadata.multimodality.code_required > 8):
        return ProcessingMode.COLLABORATIVE
        
    # Check for moderate complexity
    if (metadata.complexity.tokens_required > 5 or
        metadata.multimodality.code_required > 5):
        return ProcessingMode.DELIBERATIVE
        
    # Default to reactive for simple requests
    return ProcessingMode.REACTIVE
3. Event-Based Code Generation Services
Create specialized services for different code generation tasks:
Code Request Analyzer Service:
pythonclass CodeRequestAnalyzerService(BaseService):

        self.current_state = {}
        self._rebuild_state()
        
    def _rebuild_state(self):
        """Rebuild state from events"""
        events = self.event_store.get_events_for_entity(self.specification_id)
        
        for event in sorted(events, key=lambda e: e.timestamp):
            self._apply_event(event)
            
    def _apply_event(self, event: BaseEvent):
        """Apply event to current state"""
        event_type = event.event_type

            self.current_state["status"] = "generated"
            self.current_state["code"] = event.payload.get("result", {}).get("code")
            self.current_state["generation_completed_at"] = event.timestamp
            
        # Add more event handlers for other event types
5. API Integration for Hybrid Access
pythonclass CodeGenerationAPI:
    """API for code generation with both synchronous and asynchronous endpoints"""
    
    def __init__(self, event_bus: EventBus, state_store: StateStore):
        self.event_bus = event_bus
        self.state_store = state_store
        
    async def generate_code_sync(self, request: CodeGenerationRequest) -> CodeGenerationResponse:

            return await self._process_sync(request)
        else:
            # Fall back to async with immediate response

6. WebSocket for Real-time Updates
python@app.websocket("/ws/{request_id}")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, request_id: str):

            })
    
    # Register subscription
    subscription_id = await state_store.subscribe_to_changes(
        request_id, state_change_handler
    )
    
    try:
        # Keep connection open until client disconnects
        while True:
            data = await websocket.receive_text()
            # Process any client messages if needed
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        # Clean up subscription
        await state_store.unsubscribe(subscription_id)
