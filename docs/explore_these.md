## Neural-Inspired Template Evolution:
Create a system where templates have "synaptic connections" to each other, strengthening when they're used together successfully and weakening when they aren't. New template combinations emerge organically based on usage patterns, with some templates being "pruned" if they fall below certain usage thresholds.
___
## Biomimetic Self-Organization:
Implement a template ecosystem inspired by slime mold algorithms where templates send out "chemical signals" (event messages) when used, creating trails that other components follow. Templates naturally cluster into optimal patterns based on these traces, creating emergent specializations without explicit programming.
___
## Quantum-Inspired Probability Fields:
Instead of deterministic template selection, create a system where templates exist in probability states until "observed" (selected for use). Templates with higher coherence with the current context have higher probability of being selected, allowing for creative combinations that rigid systems would miss.
___
## Adversarial Template Evolution: 
Set up competing template systems - one generating code and another critiquing it. The generator evolves to create better templates that pass the critic's increasingly sophisticated evaluations, while the critic evolves to find more subtle issues. This creates an evolutionary pressure toward higher quality.
___
## Template Immune System:
Develop a mechanism where templates develop "antibodies" against inefficient patterns. When a template consistently leads to issues, the system creates specific counters to detect and prevent those patterns, eventually developing a sophisticated "immune memory" of anti-patterns.
___
## Stigmergic Information Exchange: 
Implement a system where templates leave "traces" in a shared environment when used in successful solutions. Other templates can sense and respond to these traces, creating emergent coordination without direct communication or central control.
___
## Entropy-Minimizing Self-Organization:
Create templates that continually reorganize to minimize information entropy in the resulting codebase. The system measures the complexity/chaos of generated code and evolves to produce more ordered, elegant solutions through local optimization decisions.

You're right to ask for actionable steps. Here's a practical implementation plan to integrate these context management features into your system:
1. Context Management Infrastructure
Step 1: Extend Your Data Models
1. Create a new `ContextMetadata` class in models/context.py with:
   - version: String (semantic versioning)
   - timestamp: DateTime
   - source_component: String
   - parent_contexts: List[ContextReference]
   - change_summary: String

2. Add a `context` field to all your key models:
   - SpecSheet
   - FormalSpecification
   - SynthesisResult
   - Project
Step 2: Create a Context Registry Service
1. Implement a `ContextRegistry` class in core/context_registry.py:
   - store_context(context_id, metadata, content)
   - get_context(context_id, version=latest)
   - list_context_versions(context_id)
   - diff_contexts(context_id, version1, version2)
   - get_context_lineage(context_id)

2. Back this with your existing storage mechanisms in StorageRepository
2. Workflow Integration
Step 3: Enhance EventBus for Context Propagation
1. Modify your WorkflowEventPayload to include:
   - context_id: String
   - context_version: String

2. Update the EventBus publish_event method to:
   - Automatically capture and attach the current context
   - Log context transitions in a dedicated topic
Step 4: Update Your Workflow Steps
1. Modify WorkflowEngine._execute_workflow to:
   - Load the complete context at the beginning of each workflow
   - Update context version when significant changes occur
   - Store updated context at each transition point

2. Implement versioning policies in workflowEngine.py:
   - When to create new versions
   - How to handle context conflicts
   - Propagation rules between components
3. Relationship Management
Step 5: Implement Relationship Tracking
1. Create a `RelationshipGraph` class in core/relationship_graph.py:
   - add_relationship(source_id, target_id, relationship_type)
   - get_dependencies(component_id)
   - get_dependents(component_id)
   - visualize_graph()

2. Automatically update this graph during workflow execution
Step 6: Cross-Reference System
1. Create a unique, persistent ID generator in utils/id_generator.py
   - format: {component_type}-{uuid}-{short_hash}

2. Implement a reference resolver in utils/reference_resolver.py:
   - resolve_reference(reference_id)
   - find_references(content)
   - update_references(content, reference_map)
4. System Implementation
Step 7: Update SpecGenerator for Context Awareness
1. Modify SpecGenerator.complete_spec_sheet to:
   - Inspect context hierarchy before completion
   - Include parent context references
   - Attach provenance information

2. Update validation to include context consistency checks
Step 8: Update SynthesisEngine
1. Modify SynthesisEngine.synthesize to:
   - Accept and validate context information
   - Incorporate context in code generation prompts
   - Tag generated code with context metadata
Step 9: Implement Context Diffing
1. Create a DiffService in utils/diff_service.py:
   - semantic_diff(old_version, new_version)
   - highlight_critical_changes(diff)
   - generate_change_summary(diff)

2. Expose through API endpoints for frontend visualization
5. Deployment and Testing
Step 10: Database Schema Updates
1. Create migration scripts for your database:
   - Add context_metadata table
   - Add context_references table
   - Add relationship_graph table

2. Implement indexing strategies for efficient lookups
These steps should be implemented sequentially, with thorough testing at each phase. You can start with the core context registry and basic metadata, then expand to the more complex features like relationship tracking and diffing.
As you implement each piece, document the extension points in your SSOT so future components can easily integrate with your context management system.
