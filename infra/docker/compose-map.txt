  Based on your question mentioning registration, API gateway, and Pulsar (a messaging system), it sounds like you're building a distributed application. Here's what I'd recommend:
The components that typically need a "map" or service registry in a distributed application are:

API Gateway - This is the most common component that needs a comprehensive service map. The gateway needs to know where to route requests to different microservices.
Service Discovery System - Often implemented with tools like Consul, etcd, or ZooKeeper, this maintains the dynamic mapping of services.
Load Balancers - They need service maps to properly distribute traffic.
Service Mesh (if used) - Solutions like Istio or Linkerd maintain detailed service maps.

Would you like me to help you implement a specific part of this system for your application? I can provide code examples for any of these components.
